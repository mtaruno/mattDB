# mattDB

This is an ongoing personal project to create my very own customized database for my personal use. I also plan on making an API where I can access the database and using Flutter to create a personal application to query the database easily for my own use. 

This is good training for creating MVPs. Inspired by [this](https://sive.rs/dbt) blog post by Derek Sivers.
